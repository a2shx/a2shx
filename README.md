**ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm an automation engineer transitioning into web development. Passionate about creating interactive and user-friendly experiences, I started my journey in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

ðŸš€ Currently diving into React, with plans to expand into Node.js and full-stack development.

ðŸ“š Now working on E-commerce project *authentication system and cart with firebase (practice for next.js typescript firebase!)!

ðŸ’¡ I love solving problems, building cool projects, and continuously learning new technologies.

ðŸ“Œ Follow my journey as I grow into a skilled developer!
