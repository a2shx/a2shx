**👋 Hi there! I'm an automation engineer transitioning into web development. Passionate about creating interactive and user-friendly experiences, I started my journey in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

🚀 Currently diving into React, with plans to expand into Node.js and full-stack development.

📚 Now working on authentication with firebase & jwt project (practice for next.js typescript firebase jwt!)!

💡 I love solving problems, building cool projects, and continuously learning new technologies.

📌 Follow my journey as I grow into a skilled developer!
