**ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm an automation engineer transitioning into web development. Passionate about creating interactive and user-friendly experiences, I started my journey in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

ğŸš€ Currently diving into React, with plans to expand into Node.js and full-stack development.

ğŸ“š Now working on Weather Report web project (practice for using State management and API)!

ğŸ’¡ I love solving problems, building cool projects, and continuously learning new technologies.

ğŸ“Œ Follow my journey as I grow into a skilled developer!
